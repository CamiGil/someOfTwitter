# AthenaWorksTestTask

It consists of a simple responsive UI to visualize the last tweets of the feed of a user.

## Usage

* First of all, you need to edit the file `server.js` (src/app/server.js) and insert your Twitter API credentials.

* Next you need to install the project's dependencies. Simply execute `npm install` on your terminal from within the project's directory.

* After that, lift the internal Twitter API by executing `npm start`. Leave that running for now and open another terminal.

* The next step is to install the Angular CLI globally. For that, you can execute `npm install -g @angular/cli` (you might need to use `sudo` if you're on Mac or Linux).

* Wrap it up by executing `ng serve` from within the project's directory and opening [http://localhost:4200/]([http://localhost:4200/]) on your browser.
